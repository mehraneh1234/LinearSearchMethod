# LinearSearchMethod
Create a Linear Search method in Python and pass it the following List to search through.
fruitlist = ["mango", "watermelon", "apple", “orange”, “grape”, “banana”]

The code file should have the Linear Search method at the top and then below it define the List data structure. The Linear Search method should have two parameters one for the List to search and another for the String to search for in the List. This search method should return the index of the location of the String if found.
Your code must be thoroughly commented and explain in detail how the Linear Search method you have created works.
Name your code file: LinearSearchMethod.py
